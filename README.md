FPGA-BeeCounter repository contains the electrical schematics of the bee counter developed in the scientific paper titled: ["*FPGA-based bee counter system*"](link). The aim of this work is the creation of a bee counter system that is capable to measure precisely the inputs and outputs of a bee hive.

The counter system schematics are eight pdf files that contain all the information necessary to interconnect the electrical components.
