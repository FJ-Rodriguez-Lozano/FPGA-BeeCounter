# FPGA-BeeCounter
FPGA-BeeCounter repository contains the electrical schematics of the bee counter developed in the scientific paper titled: ["*FPGA-based bee counter system*"](link). The aim of this work is the creation of a bee counter system that is capable to measure precisely the inputs and outputs of a bee hive.

The Electric schematics of counter system are eight pdf files that contais all the necesary information to interconnect the electric components.
